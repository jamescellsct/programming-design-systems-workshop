# Design Constraints

* Colours
* Spacing: Padding & Margin
* Sizing: Width & Height
* Border: Colour, Width & Radius
* Type Scale, Line Height & Font Weight

Why a Component Based Design System?

---

You are the design system author. Your users are other developers.

---

Don't make your _users_ write CSS. Let them compose components.

---

So, BEM or encapsulated CSS?
If you have to write CSS to prototype new UI, you've already lost.

# CSS Is A Bad API For Design Systems

‚ú® Individual magic numbers
üòï "Why is this here?"
Ô∏è‚Åâ "Can I change this without breaking the product?"
üò∞ "Why is this affecting other things on the page?"

> We've been trying OOCSS at @kickstarter (thx to @jxnblk) and it now means I can prototype new pages without writing a single line of CSS.

> If you have to write CSS to prototype new UI, you‚Äôve already lost. Tool support must be flexible. Some will use Sketch, some Figma, some photoshop. think of these in the same way you think about tech choices.

> This is part of why CSS is a bad API for DS. Every single individual magic number, every single "why is this here", "can I change this without breaking the product", "why is this affecting other things on the page".
> One-offs are deadly and CSS first-classes one-offs by default

# Tachyons

> Tachyons' main-purpose is not abbreviating inline-styles, but providing the developer with a consistent and scalable layouting-system for spacing and typography, which, at the end, is what arrives at the user.
